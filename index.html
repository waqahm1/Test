                My name is Bilal Farooq, and I am honored to stand as a candidate for the Chairman of the Gravesend and Dartford Muslim Association in the 2024 election. My journey has been shaped by a strong educational foundation, diverse
                professional experiences, and a deep commitment to community service. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, and a Master’s degree in Construction
                Management and Economics from a UK university. My professional career began in Saudi Arabia, where I worked as an engineer, followed by a role as a sub-agent in a major construction group in the UK until 2010. Since then, I have been
                self-employed in the home improvement business. In 2012, I joined the Gravesend and Dartford Muslim Association as an executive member, and in 2021, I was elected Chairman. Under my leadership, we have achieved significant milestones,
                including organizing Eid in the Park in collaboration with Shah Jalal Mosque, leading initiatives such as Interfaith Taste Ramadan, Interfaith Walk, and School Visits, and coordinating the Flag Raising Ceremony. I also organized a
                protest against the burning of the Quran, uniting local leadership to stand against hate, and conducted Q&A sessions with A-level students to promote understanding of our faith. I also took the initiative to take part in the million
                march for Palestine to represent the Gravesham community as well as organising the career work shop. If re-elected as Chairman, I am committed to giving back to the community by introducing new youth members and fresh faces who are
                ready to serve with exciting new policies. We will hold youth workshops and utilize online platforms to gather ideas and create youth sub-committees for future initiatives. Our manifesto will soon be introduced, and our candidates
                will be visiting you to explain our policies and engage with the community. I am passionate about fostering interfaith dialogue, enhancing community services, and supporting the growth and development of our community. Together, we
                can build a stronger, more inclusive future.

                My name is Omar Ilyas and I work in international business development. I have worked for some large retail and hospitality brands, managing experience, hospitality, corporate relations and international development, connecting with
                government authorities around the world as well as at council level within central London. My business experience has given me the opportunity to work in many countries across the middle east and far east, and I am able to speak a few
                languages conversationally, including Spanish and Arabic. I was born and brought up in south London to Pakistani Punjabi and Kashmiri parents, and recently moved to Gravesend where I have been impressed by the strength of the Muslim
                community. I have always been close to charitable projects and want to spend my spare time being dedicated to my faith and my local community. I am very keen to support the day to dayoperations of the masjid whilst also helping to
                develop new outreach programmes to the wider Gravesham population, supporting muslim integration within the area, as well as relations with other faith groups. I look forward to serving our community together.

                My name is Shiyamin Mohamed, I have professionally extensive experience in various ICT roles across government sectors, private enterprises, the NHS, and the United Nations - ILO. Charity is a fundamental pillar of Islam, and I am
                deeply passionate about making a positive impact in the community through dedicated charity work, particularly focusing on rural entrepreneurship and children’s educational needs. My journey in charity work began after my Graduation
                with my role at the United Nations - ILO, where I worked on a rural entrepreneurship development program in Sri Lanka. This experience ignited a profound sense of purpose and commitment to helping startups and contributing to the
                economy. Since then, I have organized fundraising campaigns to support my school, which led to the establishment of a proper organization to elevate our charity work. As one of the founders of the registered charity Old Sokians United
                kingdom and current President, I have initiated various projects benefiting the education of children at my school. These projects include donations of science books, laptops, cricket kits for the school cricket team, PA addressing
                systems, overhead projectors, air rifles for the shooting team, renovation of staff washroom facilities, enhancing hygiene for primary children, and renovation of chemistry lab. Beyond my school, also donated an ultrasound scanner to
                our local hospital to benefit community and constructed toilet facilities in rural schools, along with donating shoes, socks, and savings accounts with an initial deposit for all children. I believe that charity work is not just about
                giving but also about empowering others and fostering sustainable change. My passion is to continue contributing to meaningful charity work that benefit our community, improve the quality of life for future generations, and advocate
                for the causes I am passionate about.
