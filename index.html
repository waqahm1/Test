                <h3>Bilal Farooq - Standing for Chairman</h3>
                <p>
                  My name is Bilal Farooq, and I am honored to stand as a candidate for the Chairman of the Gravesend and Dartford Muslim Association in the 2024 election. My journey has been shaped by a strong educational foundation, diverse
                  professional experiences, and a deep commitment to community service. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, and a Master's degree in Construction
                  Management and Economics from a UK university.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My professional career began in Saudi Arabia, where I worked as an engineer, followed by a role as a sub-agent in a major construction group in the UK until 2010. Since then, I have been self-employed in the home improvement
                  business. In 2012, I joined the Gravesend and Dartford Muslim Association as an executive member, and in 2021, I was elected Chairman.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under my leadership, we have achieved significant milestones, including organizing Eid in the Park in collaboration with Shah Jalal Mosque, leading initiatives such as Interfaith Taste Ramadan, Interfaith Walk, and School Visits,
                  and coordinating the Flag Raising Ceremony. I also organized a protest against the burning of the Quran, uniting local leadership to stand against hate, and conducted Q&A sessions with A-level students to promote understanding of
                  our faith. I also took the initiative to take part in the million march for Palestine to represent the Gravesham community as well as organising the career workshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If re-elected as Chairman, I am committed to giving back to the community by introducing new youth members and fresh faces who are ready to serve with exciting new policies. We will hold youth workshops and utilize online platforms
                  to gather ideas and create youth sub-committees for future initiatives. Our manifesto will soon be introduced, and our candidates will be visiting you to explain our policies and engage with the community. I am passionate about
                  fostering interfaith dialogue, enhancing community services, and supporting the growth and development of our community. Together, we can build a stronger, more inclusive future.
                </p>
